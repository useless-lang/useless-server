# Useless Lang

## Description
Welcome to **Useless Lang**, the most delightfully pointless smart contract language you’ll ever meet! It’s a JavaScript-flavored, Solidity-tinged concoction that compiles straight to EVM bytecode—because who needs intermediate steps when you can be *this* extra? Built for dreamers who want to write contracts with a wink and a nudge, Useless lets you flex your coding chops on the Ethereum Virtual Machine without all that pesky seriousness.

**Where did the name "Useless" come from?** Picture this: a coder, bleary-eyed after 17 cups of coffee, staring at yet another Solidity contract. “This is fine,” they mutter, “but what if it was... completely unnecessary?” Thus, Useless was born—because why settle for "useful" when you can be gloriously, hilariously *useless*? It’s the language that says, “Sure, I *could* make sense, but where’s the fun in that?” Spoiler: there’s none. So here we are, proudly pointless and loving it.
